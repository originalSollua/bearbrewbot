Documentation for BearBrewBot

Python program designed to listen to twitterfeed @bearbrewbot
propper commands will cause the attached computer to attempt to run 
a coffee pot and brew the tweeted ammount of coffee.
once brewed, this should tweet back saying that the coffee is done.

run with:
    
    sudo python brewbot.py

without root acess, this code can not use the GPIO pins
ticket is intended to hold the number of communications that
the bot has sent. 
incriment this number every time it tweets, then write it back to the file.


UPDATE:
After finishing the portion of this porject that involves the Twitter API, i have decided to no longer use it
to that end, i will be rewriting the code so that the bear brew bot spins up a single user server
it will serve one pot of coffee, and require resetting.
i will also write a client application that will connect to the coffee
pot, and remain connected while coffee is brewing. 
the bot will send back status updates that the client can report to the user.
